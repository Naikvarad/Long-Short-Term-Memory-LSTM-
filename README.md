# Long-Short-Term-Memory-LSTM-
This repository contains an implementation of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. LSTMs are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture designed to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data.
They are particularly effective in tasks such as time series prediction, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

Overview:

LSTM networks are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture designed to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. While LSTMs are traditionally used for sequential data tasks such as time series prediction and natural language processing, this project explores their application in image classification tasks.

Usage:

Dataset Preparation: Ensure your dataset is properly formatted for sequential data. Each image should be represented as a sequence of features, and labels should correspond to the classes.

Model Training: Train the LSTM model using the provided script. You can customize the model architecture, hyperparameters, and training procedure according to your specific task and dataset.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model on a separate test dataset to assess its performance. Depending on the task, evaluation metrics such as accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix can be computed.
