# Long-Short-Term-Memory-LSTM-
This repository contains an implementation of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. LSTMs are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture designed to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. They are particularly effective in tasks such as time series prediction, natural language processing, and speech recognition.
